### **Introduction**  

The Indian Railways, one of the largest rail networks in the world, has embarked on an ambitious **Mission 100% Electrification** to position itself as a **"Green Railway"**. This initiative aims to reduce dependence on diesel, cut carbon emissions, and align with India’s climate commitments such as **net-zero carbon emissions by 2070**.  

However, the article highlights the **hidden costs** and unintended consequences of this policy. It critiques the premature scrapping of **functional diesel locomotives**, reliance on coal-based electricity for "green energy," and the financial burden on the Railways. The term **“greenwashing”** is used to describe how the project prioritizes optics over true sustainability.

### **Body**

#### **1. The Mission of Indian Railways: Vision and Intent**  
- The **Mission 100% Electrification** is driven by two primary goals:  
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Reducing dependence on imported crude oil.  
   - **Environmental Sustainability:** Lowering carbon emissions and achieving a **“Green Railway.”**  
- This initiative aligns with India’s commitments to the **Paris Agreement** and **COP26**, where India pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 and shift towards clean energy.

#### **2. The Hidden Costs of Electrification**  

**a) Premature Scrapping of Diesel Locomotives:**  
- The report highlights that **60% of 585 diesel locomotives** identified for replacement still have a **residual life of 15+ years**.  
- Around **760 diesel locomotives** have already been rendered redundant despite being in good working condition.  
- This creates **massive economic waste** and mismanagement of resources.  

**b) Financial Burden on Indian Railways:**  
- Full electrification requires heavy investment, and the financial burden is worsened by scrapping functional diesel assets.  
- **Strategic locomotives:** Approximately **2,500 diesel locomotives** are essential for **disaster management and strategic operations**, yet they risk becoming redundant.  
- The Railways also need to electrify **16,000 km of tracks**, which may lead to unsustainable debts and fiscal strain.

**c) Energy Source Paradox – Coal Dependency:**  
- Although electrification is marketed as an environmentally friendly initiative, nearly **50% of India’s electricity** is generated from **coal-based thermal plants**.  
- Thus, the shift to electric traction indirectly relies on fossil fuels, defeating the purpose of achieving real carbon neutrality.  
- The Railways claim of becoming “green” can be misleading, making this a **classic case of greenwashing**.  

**d) Operational and Strategic Challenges:**  
- **Diesel locomotives** provide greater operational flexibility, especially in remote, disaster-prone, or border areas where electrified networks may fail.  
- Electrification introduces **vulnerabilities** such as dependence on power supply, which can be disrupted during disasters or conflicts.  
- Overreliance on electric traction without diesel backup compromises the strategic preparedness of Indian Railways.

#### **3. The Bigger Picture: Sustainable Alternatives**  

While the goal of electrification is noble, it should not come at the cost of resource wastage, financial stress, and operational inefficiency. A more **balanced approach** is needed:  

- **Phased Transition:** Gradually phase out diesel locomotives while maximizing their utility over their full lifespan.  
- **Green Energy Sources:** Electrification should be powered by **renewable energy** like solar, wind, and hydropower instead of coal-based thermal plants.  
- **Technological Innovations:** Invest in cleaner technologies for diesel locomotives, such as biofuels, hybrid engines, or hydrogen-powered trains.  
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Conduct comprehensive economic and environmental audits before scrapping existing infrastructure.

### **Conclusion**  

The Indian Railways’ **Mission 100% Electrification** is a critical step toward achieving India’s **sustainability goals**. However, the current implementation raises concerns about **resource mismanagement**, **financial burden**, and **environmental contradictions** due to coal dependency.  

To ensure genuine progress towards a **“Green Railway”**, India must adopt a **pragmatic approach** that includes:  
1. Utilizing existing diesel locomotives to their full potential.  
2. Prioritizing **renewable energy** for powering electrification.  
3. Balancing operational flexibility with sustainability.  

The Indian Railways must avoid the pitfalls of **greenwashing** and focus on **long-term, holistic solutions** that are both environmentally and economically sustainable.
